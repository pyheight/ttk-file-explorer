# :material-file-tree: Project Introduction

## :material-message-text: Foreword

This is the [author](../author/)'s first substantial project.  

!!! info "Suggestion"
	**Building a solid foundation is crucial** - precisely because most people are unwilling to do it, it becomes especially valuable.

## :material-lightbulb-on: Project Philosophy

!!! quote "Why develop a file manager?"
    While seemingly basic, a file manager is the perfect practice for **core operating system components**. 

    Through this project:

    - :material-school: Deeply understand core GUI programming concepts
    - :material-puzzle: Master complex UI component interaction design
    - :material-rocket: Explore the limits of Python desktop applications

| Advantage | Description |
|------|------|
| :material-star-face: **Elegant Simplicity** | Modern interface built with ttkbootstrap, leaving behind traditional tkinter's dated appearance |
| :material-lightning-bolt: **Lightweight Efficiency** | Extremely low resource consumption, runs smoothly even on older hardware |
| :material-github: **Fully Open Source** | [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/pyheight/ttk-file-explorer/blob/main/LICENSE) guarantees freedom to use and modify |
| :material-book-open: **Educational Value** | Programming enthusiasts can learn complete GUI development workflows from the source code |

## :material-alert: Current Limitations

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :octicons-package-24: **Platform Constraints**  
Currently only supports Windows due to underlying API dependencies.

- :octicons-beaker-24: **Functional Limitations**  
Not intended to fully replace system file managers; positioned as a development reference case.
